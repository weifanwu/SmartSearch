# SmartSearch

SmartSearch is an advanced search application inspired by PerplexityAI. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and contextually relevant search results.

## Features
- **RAG-based Search**: Combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative models to enhance search accuracy.

## Frontend
- Developed using React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Utilizes modern React hooks and components for efficient state management and rendering.
